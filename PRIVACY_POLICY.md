# Usage of Data

The discord bot may utilise stored data, as clarified below, for the functionality of different features included but not limited to: Welcoming joining users and logging commands (when enabled).
No usage of data outside of the previously stated cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

# Stored Information

The bot may store the following information once a configuration command is used:

guildID with the ID of the server,
guildName with the name of the server,
logchannelId with the logging channel ID (If set),
welcomechannelId with the welcome channel ID (If set)

No other information than the above-mentioned information will be stored.

# Updating Data

The data may be updated when updating the preferences of the server.
Updating data will require the input of an end-user. Data that can be seen as sensitive, such as the content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands. No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

# Removal of Data

## Automatic removal

Stored data can be removed automatically by removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server.

## Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at
solvit.pt@gmail.com using the following format:

Header: Request to delete data from Nagatoro
Please include your server's ID within the body of your email along with any information youâ€™d like to share.

For security reasons we request you to supply us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed. Only the server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.
